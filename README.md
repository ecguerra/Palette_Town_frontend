## Installation Instructions
* Set up backend repo
* Download and install all dependencies
* Create a user and start making some palettes!


## User Stories
* As a user, I want to make an account
* As a user, I want to log into my account
* As a user, I want to view different colors
* As a user, I want to save different colors to my palette
* As a user, I want to remove colors from my palette
* As a user, I want to edit my palettes
* As a user, I want to delete my palettes

## Stretch Goals
- [] Allow users to set their palettes to 'public' or 'private'
- [] Allow users to save public palettes to their favorites
- [] Create a homepage that shows the top-saved palettes and most recently-created palettes
- [] Allow users to start with a color when creating a palette
- [] Allow users to view specific color families
- [] Allow users to view analogous and complementary colors
- [] Allow users to generate a palette from an image


## General Approach
I love color and design and wanted to try to build a color-choosing site. It was a fun project overall and really helped me understand state better than before. Now that I have the basic app operational, I'm excited to continue to build out my stretch goals and really put my own spin on things.


## Challenges
Getting the auth credentials to pass from the backend to the frontend was by far the hardest challenge I faced with this app. I became well-acquainted with the many different ways to throw a CORS error. I eventually solved my auth issues with a lot of reading (and some very patient friends willing to help with debugging).

## Acknowledgements

Thank you to my General Assembly instructors and IAs (Billie, Mateen, Fatima, and Khoury) for your knowledge, help, and support.

Big shoutout to the "Room 5 crew" (Monica, Dan, Taylor, Camille, Salima, Gabe, Lam, Vanessa, and Naomi) for the debugging, sanity checks, and commiserating.

And of course, thank you to Andy for making sure I ate regularly and for putting up with a grouchy code gremlin for 6 months.
